# 0.0 Beginners Spaceship Construction 
repo for materials used regularly for SB work. Consider renaming as ```project STC``` - stand in phrase should be unique/recognisable, all-caps, easy to search and replace.

```

```

See below for the nascent blog-ish post which created this repo. The below should ideally be moved to a more narrative repo of unknown descent. Consider how these _documentation pages_ will be arranged in this setup. In documents?

This repo should be pullable and usable for SB projects (16S focused ATM).

# Github Setup

---

_Essentially_, ```blogging X.0```. No longer sure what age we're living in, but it's at least up to 8 by now. In any case, the intention here is to amalgamate creative outputs, professional outputs, and learning outputs into one cohesive system which is distributed across points and easily transferable (cf: evernote and google, which are not). 

Ultimate likely is to have a private server of sorts, which is partially mirrored in GH &/ BB, and the APC remote. Note that vivaldi,  Markor, and RStudio all support common markdown formatting - clear path of unity there. Additionally, an RProj created in a versioned dir will auto-register the repo details.

Intention is to keep private material private - public stays public.

## Goals:

   1. version of the default (SOP) SB approach
   2. version of jfg_materials
   3. projects: ernesto, cogitatR, cloud-deployment. 

---

This session: chart creation of GH (sb_4.11)  repo, a la a blog post SOP amalgam. Apologies to the viewer for any apparent recursions, but sensible at time of press.

Will also need to rename the repo at a later stage to be in line with personal style guidelines (e.g. ```SB__4.11``` at least). 

### options for creating:

We're going to push a set of organised local files to GH as a repo. Will need to locally, manually, copy and version a rake of existing materials (16S pipe modern and ancestral, jfg functions, comm_ledgers, etc.), in such a way that they can be updated sensibly at a later point. 

#### copy material to folder

In folder ```sb_4.11```, copying and arranging 

   * R: 
      * 16S standard flow (not SOP)
      * jfg_functions
   * bash:
      * 16S bash script
      * vsearch / tax script
      * rsync stuff
      * admin stuff
   * py:
      * ancestral reference scripts & co for ANCOM, LEfSe, SparCC
 
#### ```git``` a folder
 From [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/life/16/7/stumbling-git). Use HTTPS unless you have write access (SSH). Could also selectively download files, but possibly file won't exist until properly configured through ```make``` or similar.

files can be in one of three states:

   * ```tracked``` : present, up to date, and versioned in the git system
   * ```untracked``` : not yet, or not to be, added
   * ```staged``` : changed and awaiting commit

```

# get someone elses repo
git clone [https://repo.url/reponame.git]

# make your own git in the above-filled folder
git init ~/Dropbox/SeqBiome/sb_4.11/
   > Initialized empty Git repository in /home/jfg/Dropbox/SeqBiome/sb_4.11/.git/

# "stage" all the files copied previously to the tracking system
git add ~/Dropbox/SeqBiome/sb_4.11/      # this can also be done piece-meal

git reset .      # and undone with similar control..

git status    # info on tracked, staged, untracked
 
```

#### setup & configure the repo folder in ```git```

First, we'll need to establish ```--rw```  privileges between the host (GH) and the local repo. Although we've previously made an SSH key, it's repeated below - this is then added to the list of SSH keys in your account (i.e. write permission from each of your relevant devices) at [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys.). Who knows what a GPG key is!

```
ssh-keygen
less ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

```

Secondly, we'll need to set our user name and email (ideally matching that of the cloud service we're using) in order to commit and push - the system needs someone accountable for these actions 

```
# setup identity
git config --global user.email "genoreplicate@gmail.com"
git config --global user.name "handibles"
```

Third, we ```commit``` the changes to the repo, adding the files we originally copied to the manifest. The git is now versioned and live!

```
git commit -m "initial copy of jfg's R, py and bash work"

```

Check what you did by calling up the repo ```log```

```
git log      # can use --oneline to simplify things
> commit 6954c258ea2f9e42dd89762fb94bf7a3117415b7 (HEAD -> master)
> Author: handibles <genoreplicate@gmail.com>
> Date:   Wed May 29 14:29:43 2019 +0100
> 
>     initial copy of jfg's R, py and bash work

```

#### Sync repo with ```GH``` via ```git```
Finally, we can ```push``` the material from local to remote (in this case, GH). Note, this isn't necessary! In fact, GH is just a convenience layer that obfuscates ```git```'s true purpose: ```version control``` - a robust system of managing inputs, changes and authorship.   (code from GH site)

```
##  push an existing repository from the command line
git remote add origin https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git
git push -u origin master
> Username for 'https://github.com': handibles
> Password for 'https://handibles@github.com': 
> Counting objects: 60, done.
> Delta compression using up to 12 threads.
> Compressing objects: 100% (59/59), done.
> Writing objects: 100% (60/60), 192.15 KiB | 11.30 MiB/s, done.
> Total 60 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
> remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (1/1), done.
> To https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git
>  * [new branch]      master -> master
> Branch 'master' set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.

```

Note, that should have simply worked as have added SSH key. This can be fixed by setting the default protocol to ```SSH``` (from ```HTTPS```)

```
# checlk the protocol in use - probably HTTPS
git remote -v
> origin	https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git (fetch)
> origin	https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git (push)

# change
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11.git

# check modified
origin	git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11.git (push)

```


After this, merged the ```STC format``` project with the sb_4.11 git (i.e. added material from STC to 4.11). Remember, adding, commiting and pushing are separate actions that need to be done in turn if you want to see anything up on the cloud.

Alternatively, such options exist for connecting a GH repo to a source - the annointed, appointed, or disjointed:

```
## Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
# Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
HTTPS --or-- SSH https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git

## …or create a new repository on the command line
echo "# sb_4.11" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/handibles/sb_4.11.git
git push -u origin master

## …or import code from another repository
# You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.

```
