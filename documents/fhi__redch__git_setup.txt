## problem - need to add local redch branch to the remote (master, origin) branch on GH.com
## that way, gh works as envisioned - projects are forks of the sb_4.11 master
## alos, avoids having to add extra repos to gh

# add redch unde rthe 4.11 master
# HOWEVER, as we clone using SSH, need to ADD SSH also
git remote add redch git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11

# check
git remote -v
# > redch	git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11 (fetch)
# > redch	git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11 (push)

# add your new redch repo to the sb.4.11 repo
# (as master is saved as your remote master, as above) 
git push redch master 


# > To github.com:handibles/sb_4.11
# > ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
# > error: failed to push some refs to 'git@github.com:handibles/sb_4.11'
# > hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do

# so, as per note in git pull -help, need to pull from master, unify at local, then push back.


## however:

git pull
# > There is no tracking information for the current branch.
# > Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
# > See git-pull(1) for details.
# >     git pull <remote> <branch>
# > If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:
# >     git branch --set-upstream-to=redch/<branch> redch


## neither work:
git pull sb_4.11 master
git pull git@github.com/handibles/sb_4.11 master
# > fatal: 'git@github.com/handibles/sb_4.11' does not appear to be a git repository
# > fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
# >
# > Please make sure you have the correct access rights
# > and the repository exists.


## and then: 
git branch --set-upstream-to=sb_4.11/master redch
git branch --set-upstream-to=git@github.com/handibles/sb_4.11/master redch
# > error: the requested upstream branch 'sb_4.11/master' does not exist

git fetch git@github.com/handibles/sb_4.11
# > no joy


## start again =============================


# make a new remote (GH) repo, delete all the local git stuff, then start fresh

git init
# > Initialized empty Git repository in /home/handibles/Dropbox/Ferment/fhi__redch/.git/

git add .
git commit -m 'start commit for climber'
git remote add origin ssh://git@github.com/handibles/climber
git push origin master

# >  * [new branch]      master -> master


## make sensible names =============================
	 
## cant get head around terminology - make branch "teach", and remove master
## resist urge to make branch "write" or "develop" etc., as will (should) be "live"
##	-	might need one if usiung GHpages?...

## delete the spurious "master" branch made whilst dicking around
## note "origin" replaces "remote" here in most cases... <?>
git push origin :master 	# delete "master"
# > To ssh://github.com/handibles/climber
# >  - [deleted]         master


## attempt delete the original GH comit branch, "main"
git push origin :main 		# delete "main"
# > To ssh://github.com/handibles/climber
# >  ! [remote rejected] main (refusing to delete the current branch: refs/heads/main)
# > error: failed to push some refs to 'ssh://github.com/handibles/climber'

## need to change the "current" branch on GH? (hilariously, I could jsut have renamed it on GH...)
## can do this on the site: change default to teach. is there a programmatic way? Maybe. Is there infinite time? No.
## try delete main again:
git push origin :main 		# delete "main"
# > To ssh://github.com/handibles/climber
# >  - [deleted]         main	# success!


## host as a site =============================

## go > repo (teach)
## go > settings > pages
## set teach to source for pages; save
## set jekyll theme:

## set a gitignore (+ other rm messing), and push back to remote (origin), setting remote (origin) as "upstream"
git push --set-upstream origin teach

# >    b4b7882..a722754  teach -> teach
# > Branch 'teach' set up to track remote branch 'teach' from 'origin'.  # <--- note! **

## make a 'docs' folder for storing the site stuff, with text file inside (no empty folders thx)
git add .
git commit -m "add docs folder to GH"
git push
# > .... # all fine, docs appears on GH

## linking pages: simply use a relative link
# > <a href="analysis/fhi__redch__assembly.html">Its a real thing</a>
## change the name of the output (better page names)


## project management  =====================================================================

    ## dont do this yet! unify teach first


## for chickshot and redch, clone different branches, because the folder name doesn't matter!
## create from a remote branch! https://phoenixnap.com/kb/git-create-new-branch#create-a-branch-from-a-remote-branch
## push branch to remote origin: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-push-to-remote-branch-how-to-push-a-local-branch-to-origin/

## now for both, can clone branches to local and proceed in different directions, while pulling changes in reference material as we go...
cd ~/Dropbox/Ferment/
git clone --single-branch --branch fhi__redch ssh://git@github.com/handibles/climber   # note single-branch, note name will be repo name
git clone --single-branch --branch fhi__chickshot ssh://git@github.com/handibles/climber


## delete branches if done incorrectly
git branch -d  fhi__redch fhi__chickshot
