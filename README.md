# CLIMBER - CLI, Microbial Ecology, and R


Hosted page for doing a number of basic steps in microbial ecology, focusing on the processing of `NextGen` illumina data, into either `amplicon` (e.g. 16S) or `metagenomic` (e.g. shotgun) datasets. 

If this appeals to you (and why wouldn't it), please dampen your squibs slightly - it's not written yet, and certianly barely ready to be used. Realistically, we'll need to separate things out into `recipes`, and have them cross-linked. This perhaps could be followed up with a `justthecode` flow for those who are keen to get thigns very, very wrong.

Enough of this; lets make like tracked changes and train.
